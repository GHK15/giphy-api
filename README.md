# giphy-api
**What the project does**
This project utilizes the Giphy API and an ajax call to generate ten fruit-related gifs (and respective ratings) on the page. Users may click on the pre-populated buttons or input their favorite fruits to create new buttons that add ten more gifs to the page. Clicking on the static gif animates it; another click turns the gif static again.

**Libraries / Tools**
1. Bootstrap
2. jQuery
3. Giphy API
